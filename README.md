I work across multiple operating systems, ensuring all my profiles are well-organized and synchronized.

- **Arch Linux / Artix Linux** serve as my primary environments for developing web applications, Linux tools, and Android applications. Check out my [Arch Linux Dotfiles](https://github.com/codeitlikemiley/huawei-mb13-dotfiles-archlinux) and [Artix Linux Dotfiles](https://github.com/codeitlikemiley/artix-dotfiles), along with my custom [Simple Terminal Build](https://github.com/codeitlikemiley/st) and [Custom DWM Build](https://github.com/codeitlikemiley/dwm).
- **MacBook Pro 14 M1** is my go-to device for crafting iOS and macOS applications. Explore my [macOS Dotfiles](https://github.com/goldcoders/mac-m1-dotfiles).
- **Asus G14** is the machine I use for developing Android and Windows applications. Here are my [Windows Dotfiles](https://github.com/goldcoders/windows-10-dotfiles).

Currently, I primarily use macOS due to its superior capabilities for configuring keymaps with Karabiner Elements.

Check out my [10X Developer Workflow on Mac](https://github.com/codeitlikemiley/10x-dev-macosx-workflow)!

I have standardized my text editors to utilize consistent Vim key motions.

If you use any of the following text editors or IDEs and want to enhance your efficiency, consider exploring my configurations:

- [IntelliJ Settings for Kotlin](https://github.com/codeitlikemiley/kotlin-settings)
- [Android Studio Settings](https://github.com/codeitlikemiley/android-studio-settings)
- [Rust Rover Settings](https://github.com/codeitlikemiley/rust-rover-settings)
- [Neovide Rust Edition for Rust Development](https://github.com/codeitlikemiley/nvim)
- [Xcode Settings](https://github.com/codeitlikemiley/xcode-settings)
- [VSCode with Neovim](https://github.com/codeitlikemiley/vscode-neovim)
- [Zed Configuration](https://github.com/codeitlikemiley/zed-config)

If these workflows improve your productivity, feel free to give me a star!

Iâ€™ve been programming in Rust since 2019. It was challenging initially, but persistence has paid off.

Now, most of my projects are written in Rustâ€”some are open-source contributions, while others are proprietary.

Here are some notable projects from my Rust collection:

- [Rust Duplex Server](https://github.com/codeitlikemiley/duplex-server-rs) - A highly scalable and performant Rust server designed to handle both RESTful and gRPC APIs, built with modern Rust frameworks like tonic for gRPC and axum for REST API.
- [Ntext Turso Backend](https://github.com/codeitlikemiley/ntext-tursoâ€“backend) - Build your next backend server using the fastest framework in Rust.
- [Rust on Steroids](https://github.com/codeitlikemiley/rust-on-steroids) - A reproducible full-stack Rust development environment, perfect for Codespace or Docker Dev Containers.
- [GRPC Server Template](http://github.com/codeitlikemiley/server_template) and [GRPC Services Template Generator](http://github.com/codeitlikemiley/service_template).
- [Workspace CLI](http://github.com/codeitlikemiley/ws-cli) to effectively manage your Rust workspace.
- [Snippet Management CLI](https://github.com/codeitlikemiley/snipr) for organizing your snippets in Neovim and VSCode.
- [Rust VSCode Plugin - Cargo Runner](https://github.com/codeitlikemiley/cargo-runner) - A tool designed to enhance your productivity with Rust.
